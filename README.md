## Motivation:
After being frustrated with how difficult it was to find and print a Dactyl keyboard, I came up with a this, the ultimate 3D printed split column stagged ergonomic keyboard.
The mechanical design is inspired by torsion and compression bridges, which allow the keyboard to be printed in multiple, simple parts, and then assembled into a solid keyboard.
Depending on the material and thicknesses used, the keyboard can not only have its layout customised, but its sound signiture too.


## Design Goals:
 - Customisable: An `.stl` or proprietary design file is not enough.
 - Truly ergonomic: Everyone has different hands, so there is no "one size fits all".
 - Easy to make: A 19h print made of mostly support material is not ideal.
 - Truly open-source: Ideas are welcomed, contributions are cherished!
